<h1>Budget Monitoring Report</h1>

<p>Version: 1.1.1 - 20190310</p>

<p>
The report monitors the actual expenses and income of the current month compared to the budget
of the current month. 
</p>
<p>
The first section shows the overall comparison of

<ul>
    <li>expenses (actual value) vs income (reference value)</li>
    <li>income (actual value) vs budget (reference value)</li>
    <li>expenses (actual value) vs budget (reference value)</li>
</ul>
in separate circulare gauge charts. The actual value is displayed as the red needle and the 
reference value as the blue triangle.
</p>
<p>
The second and third section show the comparison of the actual values compared to the budget for
each category, which has at least a budget or an actual value. The actual values are displayed as
colored bars, the budget marks the 50% reference value of the bar.
</p>
<h2>Value Ranges</h2>
<p>
As it should be possible to show the cases, when the actual value is higher than the reference
value, the reference value is set at 50% of the complete value range.
</p>
<p>
The green area marks a good state, where 10% over (withdrawal) or under (deposit) budget
is still acceptable.
</p>
<h2>Data prerequesites for using this report</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You should have some actual income at the beginning of the month, since the comparison
        to the expenses won't make much sense in other cases. If there is no income, the summed
        income will be set as half of the expenses, so that the expense needle is in the dark
        red range of the circular gauge.</li>
    <li>You should have created a budget for the current month, which should have the name <code>YYYY-MM</code>.</li>
    <li>Each category and its subcategories should contain only transactions with the same transaction
        code. I.e. each category should be either a Withdrawal category or a Deposit category.</li>
    <li>The <em>transfer</em> transactions and <em>void</em> transactions will not be taken into account.</li>
</ul>
